        <img id="q2" src="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp14/images/pairprogramming.jpg"/>
        <p> Pair programming is important to DBC because it is the way code is written in the real world. DBC wants their students to become comfortable with pair programming so that they can excel after graduation. It is easy to get stuck when programming by yoursel, so by working with a partner you are more likely to overcome any obstacles you encounter. </p>

      <div class="question">
        <h2> Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
        <p> The Driver is the partner that does the typing and physically writes the code. The Driver also offers feedback on the code and helps guide the Navigator. <br><br>
          The Navigator is the partner who is in charge of directing what should be written. He/She instructs the driver on what to write and control what part of the code is being worked on. </p>
