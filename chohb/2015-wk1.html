<h1 style="text-align: center">2015 Commissioner's Report</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Week 1</h2>

<p>The 2015 season is officially under way! Unfortunately we did not all become millionaires this week, <a href="/chohb/draftking-lineups.html">thanks a lot Minder and Mike</a>, but it was still great to have football back in our lives. Absence really does make the heart grow fonder. </p>

<p>Week 1 is always the best week because half of you clowns still don't know what a win tastes like, and the other half can't imagine how your team will ever lose a game this year. Best of all, everyone still thinks they have a chance at the cup. Time to burst some bubbles.</p>

<h2 class="c-header">Cream Of The Crop </h2>
<h3><span style="color:black; font-weight: bold;">Super Mariota Bros</span> <span style="font-weight: normal">145.66</span></h3>

<p>Every undefeated team in the history of sports has started off 1-0. I'm not guaranteeing I will go undefeated, but I would have whooped any of your sorry ass teams that played me this week. My first victim this season was Warren, but he deserves it for drafting DeSean Jackson. Come on man. </p>

<p>Everyone bitched about Chip Kelly not trading up in the first round to get Marcus Mariota, yet no one drafted him in 16 rounds. I not only had the god like fantasy foresight to pick up Mariota and start him in Week 1 but I also traded for his favorite target Kendall Wright. Bow before me bitches.</p>

<h2 class="c-header">Biggest Upset</h2>

<h3><span style="color:black; font-weight: bold;">Miracle Run</span> <span style="font-weight: normal">115.06</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:black; font-weight: bold;">Lacy Sunday</span> <span style="font-weight: normal">107.70</span></h3>

<p>The biggest upset this week was Chris finding a way to beat Andrea. This is the biggest upset not only because Yahoo gave Andrea the best grade for her draft, but also because new owners in our league always do very well. Dom had the most dominant team his first year before an Eli-Manningish upset in the championship game by Eric. Minder luck boxed his way to a championship last year. Andrea is the team to watch out for this year.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, <span style="font-weight: bold">Lacy Sunday</span> is the highest scoring team with a loss. Despite not being able to get a full point from Peyton Manning, Andrea still almost pulled out a win. In fact, if we never make a trade, and Kendall Wright plays instead of Larry Fitzgerald, Andrea wins this match up. You're welcome for the assist Chris.</p>

<h2 class="c-header">Richard Sherman Trash Talking Award</h2>

<p>This is a category that was created by Mike last year. Unfortunately we were all a bunch of vaginas in Week 1 and nobody talked any shit. This has to change this week. Make some noise people.</p>

<h2 class="c-header">Draft Kings Lineup</h2>

<p>Mike and Minder <a href="/chohb/draftking-lineups.html">both shit the bed</a> last week and couldn't finish in the top 125,000 to cash. Hopefully, this week we have a little bit more to cheer about.</p>

<p>Since Dom is hosting the Eagles Cowboys game at his house this week, he will have the honor of selecting this week's lineup. I will post his lineup before Sunday's kickoff so we all know which players we should be rooting for.</p>

<h2 class="c-header">Week 2 Plans</h2>

<p>Dom has graciously invited us all over his house this week to watch the Eagles take first place in the NFC East with a win over the Cowboys. It is always a great place to watch games, so even though the game isn't until 4:00, you won't find a better place to watch the early games so why not come for both.</p>

<p>Any interest in a pick up touch football game before? Just putting it out there.</p>

<p>I know Eric has volunteered to taxi this week but I'm not sure if his car is full or not. If you are looking for a ride, contact him.</p>

<p>I'm sure Dom will post his address in the group chat before Sunday. I hope to see you all there. Except Vinny and Andrea. Have fun in Italy you lucky bastards.</p>


<p>That's all I have for this week. Hopefully, I will actually be consistent in doing these reports every week but I make no promises.</p>

<p>Go fuck yourself San Diego <br><br>
