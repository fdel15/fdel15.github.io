Version Control, Git, and GitHub

09/20/2014

Version control keeps track of the changes you make to a file. There are many benefits to using version control. One of the main benefits is that it allows you to revert back to an earlier version of your file if something goes wrong while you are making changes. By flipping through the different versions you can see how your file has progressed over time. Version control becomes more important when working on the same files with collaborators because it allows all of the collaborators to work on the same file at the same time without overwriting each other's code.

Git is a version control system. It keeps track of all of the changes you make to a file by using the "commit" comand. Every time you execute a commit, you create a new version of your file with the added changes. Git only allows you to execute the commit command when new changes have been added to the file. Git tracks who made the changes to the file, what changes were made, and when the changes were made.

GitHub is a Git repository web-based hosting service which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding own features. There are several benefits for using GitHub to store your code.One benefit is that it allows you to access your code from any computer as long as you have an internet connection. Since you can access the code from any computer, it makes it easy to share your code with other programmers so that you can work as a team on a project. GitHub also makes it easy to keep the changes synchronized between all of the collaborators so that everyone is working from the same version of the code.

GitHub has also been described as the new resume. It allows devleopers to showcase their code as well as their involvment in the GitHub community. It is important to store your code on GitHub so that future potential employers can see your work. An active GitHub account may be the difference between whether or not you get the job you are applying for.
