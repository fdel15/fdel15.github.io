<p>One of my favorite TED talks is <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days/transcript?language=en">Try something new for 30 days</a> by Matt Cutts. It's a very short talk, and he ends it by saying the following: </p>

<p class="quote">So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! For the next 30 days.</p>

<p>My plan is to do 12 30 day challenges that will make me a better programmer.</p>
