<p>When learning CSS I found myself asking what the heck is a class, an ID, and why should I care? In this blog post I am going to expalin the difference between ID's, Classes, and when you should use each.</p>

<p>A class is a group of elements that are the same or similar. The most important thing to remember about classes is that they are not unique. This means that you can use the same class on multiple elements and you can have as many elements as you want in a class.</p>

<p>An ID is a singular identifier of one HTML tag. The most important thing to remember about ID's is that they are unique. Each element can have only one ID and each page can only have one element with that ID. Your code will not pass validation if you use the same ID on more than one element. One of the main benefits of using ID's is that they can be accessed directly through a hash value.</p>

<p>So when should you use each one? Any time you want to apply the same styling to multiple elements you want to use a class.</p>

<p>Let's use our Berkshire website as an example. Take a look at the heading of the page:</p>

<img src="/img/Berkshire_heading.png"/>

<p>The heading to the web page is unique to this page. You are not going to want to have this element repeated so an ID makes sense here. I use an id to create a container for the entire heading and add all of the characteristics that are shared within the heading.</p>

<img src="/img/id_img.png"/>

<p>Now I want you to focus on the top line. Notice how the B and the H are larger than the rest of the font? This is a good example on when you would want to use a class since this is a style that will be repeated.</p>

<img src="/img/class_img.png"/>

<p>Any time I want to make text twice as big as normal I can use this class to style the element.</p>

<p>So what does my HTML code look like?</p>

<img src="/img/berkshire_html.png"/>

<p>Notice how I am able to call boldbluetext class (I admit I probably should have named this something better) twice. Once for the H and again for the B.</p>

<p>I hope this blog post was able to help you understand the differences between classes and ids a little bit better. If you are still confused, try to write a blog post explaining the differences and best practices because I know it helped me to understand them a lot better.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
