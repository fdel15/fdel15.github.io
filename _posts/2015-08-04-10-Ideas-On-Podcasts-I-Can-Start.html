<p>About 6 months ago, I didn't listen to any podcasts. Now I often find my phone running out of memory because I have too many podcast episodes. Currently my favorite podcasts are <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbie</a>, <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">Ruby Rogues</a>, and <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/">StartUp</a>. I decided to think of 10 podcasts I could host. </p>
