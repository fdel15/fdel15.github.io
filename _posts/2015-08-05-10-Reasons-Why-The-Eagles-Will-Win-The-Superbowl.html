<p>For better or worse, until death do us part, I am a Philadelphia Eagles fan. Unfortunately, it is usually for worse instead of better. However, the Philadelphia Eagles will win SuperBowl 50. I am not one of those fans that say this every year during training camp, but this year is the year and here are 10 reasons why: </p>

<h4>The Ideas</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Chip Kelly</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>In Chip I trust. His philosophy on winning transcends outside of football and I 100% believe in his vision and his ability to make changes when necessary.</li></ul>
  <li>Sam Bradford</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>I believe he is the kind of quarterback that will thrive in Chip's offense. Peyton Manning and Drew Brees both switched teams after being injured and have had huge success.</li></ul>
  <li>Locker Room Culture</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Chip has made a lot of big changes this offseason. The two things in common with all of these moves are he got rid of players who believed they are super stars and he brought in players that want to be an Eagle and want to buy in to Chip's system.</li></ul>
  <li>Kiko Alonso</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>An absolute super star his Rookie season before getting hurt last year and he played for Chip at Oregon</li></ul>
  <li>New Secondary</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Our defense is not as bad the stats say last year. They are aggressive and force a lot of turnovers. A secondary full of physical big defensive backs will prevent us from giving up as many big plays.</li></ul>
  <li>Depth At Running Back</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>DeMarco Murray, Darren Sproles, and Ryan Mathews.</li></ul>
  <li>Depth At LineBacker</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Alonso, Kendricks, Ryans, Graham, and Smith. All solid.</li></ul>
  <li>Great Offensive Line</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Jason Peters and Jason Kelce are the best Tackle and Center in the league.</li></ul>
  <li>Playmakers at WR</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Losing Maclin hurts, but Jordan Mathews, Nelson Agholor, and Josh Huff are much more explosive than our starting wide receivers last year.</li></ul>
  <li>Tim Tebow</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Wait what? Hear me out. My bold prediction is that the Eagles will go for 2 points after every touchdown instead of kicking an extra point this year. Tim Tebow is going to be our specialty goal line/ 2 point conversion quarterback and will give us a huge advantage in this part of the field.</li></ul>
