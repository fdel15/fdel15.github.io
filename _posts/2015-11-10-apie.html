<p>APIE is an acronymn for the four most important concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. I love using acronymns to help me remember things. I wanted to write a blog post about each concept connecting the formal definition with an example in Ruby.</p>

<h4>Abstraction</h4>
<h4 class="sub-heading">Definition</h4>

<p>The act of representing essential features without including background details or explanations. It is simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.</p>

<p>The first example that comes to mind for me is the Ruby on Rails framework. I recently just built my own Ruby MVC framework, with a lot of similarities to Rails. One of the main reasons why the Rails framework seems so magical is because it hides a lot of complexity with a simple interface. </p>

<p>An example of this is ActiveRecord. If you follow Rails conventions, then instances of your model classes will include a bunch of methods defined in ActiveRecord such as "all" or "where". These simple methods allow you to make calls to your database (usually in SQL but it depends on the database you are using) without writing any SQL. </p>
