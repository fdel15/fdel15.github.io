<p>I am currently working as a Curriculum Engineer at Codecademy. It is a contract to hire position, and the next week and a half will determine if it turns into a full time position for me.</p>

<h4>The Ideas</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go through LTC and Ruby tutorials and copy the narratives by hand into a notebook.</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Will help me become familiar with the Codecademy pattern for writing</li></ul>
  <li>Become one with the thesaurus</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Use a thesaurus adamantly to break down vocabulary words into smaller understandable pieces</li></ul>
  <li>Stop being shy</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Initiate more conversations inside the office</li></ul>
  <li>Fake it till you make it</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Make it a priority to attend all hands on meetings and project demos as if you were already a full time employee.</li></ul>
  <li>Listen to feedback</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li> Bana and Yael want me to succeed. Pay attention to their feedback and adjust appropriately.</li></ul>
  <li>Ask people for their opinions</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Find people you can trust and ask them if what you wrote is clear. The trick is finding people you can trust to be honest with you.</li></ul>

    <ul class="sublist"><li>Will help me write tests</li></ul>
  <li>Ask for specific feedback</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>Don't assume what your strengths/weaknesses are. Ask what you can do better and make an effort to do better.</li></ul>
</ol>
