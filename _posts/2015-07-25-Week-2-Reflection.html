title: Week 2 - Write, Read, Study
category: Reflections
---

<p>My commitment to blogging more frequently is off to a rough start. It has been three weeks since my last blog post. I don't think it is a coincidence that this blog post and the previous one were both written on Saturday's that I did not have to travel back and forth from Philadelphia to New York, but I don't like making excuses, and I should be blogging more often than once a week. I will get better at this.</p>

<h4>Previous Short Term Goals:</h4>

<li>I did finish building a social network in Ruby on Rails. You can <a href="http://www.codesnaps.io/">view CodeSnaps here</a>.</li>
<li>I have not been working on my Equibase project. I need to store the information in a database and then build a front end to display it.</li>
<li>When I was looking into the React.js tutorial I got side tracked by a comment about how they built their own ruby web server for the tutorial and <a href="https://github.com/fdel15/simple_ruby_server">decided to do the same thing instead</a></li>
<li>I did not attempt to build <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/contact_manager.html">Contact Manager</a></li>
<li>I did finish the Final 4 chapters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Science-Practice-5th-Edition/dp/0205609996">Influence: Science And Practice</a></li>

<p>I have been doing a better job at reading more. As previously mentioned I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Science-Practice-5th-Edition/dp/0205609996">Influence: Science And Practice</a>, I also read <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">Why's Poignant Guide To Ruby</a>, and am making it a habit to read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> every day. This should lead to me blogging more frequently and about interesting topics.</p>

<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/014312417X">Mastery by Robert Greene</a>. I am about a third of the way through and it has been great so far. It is one of those books that motivates you while you read it. I have been faithfully taking notes throughout the book, and will be doing a full review as soon as I finish.</p>

<h4>Accomplishments</h4>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Job Search</h4>

<p>I no longer have to make the commute every Saturday from Philly to NYC because my Codecademy Labs class is officially over. It was a great experience that I am very fortunate to of had. I got to meet some really cool, interesting, and smart people, and I honestly believe I learned more from the students than they learned from me over the last 12 weeks. Fortunately, I am still currently working at Codecademy. I am currently helping them to develop content in a contract to hire position. It would be great if they do decide to hire me full time at the end of the contract.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">GitHub: 0, 0, 0 Commits</h4>

<p>I did not write any code on any of my projects this week. I made a few commits to a private Codecademy repo, but they do not count. I need to spend more time writing code.</p>

<h4>What To Work On For Next Week</h4>

<p>I have simplified what I need to work on into three things:</p>

<li>Write code</li>
<li>Read code</li>
<li>Study software architecture</li>

<p>Specific details for each of these will be listed in short term goals</p>

<h4>Long Term Goals</h4>

<p>I have put more thought into my long term goals so they are different from last weeks post. Ideally, these goals should be consistent each week until I accomplish them, or have a good reason to pivot.</p>

<li>Get Hired by Buffer</li>
<p><dd>This is still my main goal because nothing is guaranteed with Codecademy</dd></p>

<li>10,000 commits on GitHub by January 1st, 2016.</li>
<p><dd>Current number of commits: <span style="font-weight: bold">1,609</span></dd></p>

<li>Read 25 books by January 1st, 2016</li>
<dd><p>Current number of books read: <span style="font-weight: bold">0</span></p></dd>
<p>My New Years goal for 2016 is going to be to read 100 books for the year. This mini-goal is to help me develop the habit of reading everyday.</p>

<h4>Gratitude</h4>

<p>Three things I am grateful for this week are: </p>

<li>Codecademy Labs Class of 2015</li>

<p>I do not think I could of asked for a greater group of students. This was my first time teaching a class, and they were all so passionate about wanting to learn and willing to work together that it made my job easy. I loved learning so many interesting things about why they decided to take the Labs Class and how many of them were already doing some form of coding in their job despite never really learning it. I have also been really touched by how many of them have reached out to recruiters and companies they currently work at to try and find me full-time work. I never asked any of them to do that, and the fact that they did is just awesomely nice.</p>

<li>Codecademy</li>

<p>Kind of corny they make it on this list two weeks in a row right? But if the hat fits wear it. I am very grateful once again for Codecademy because they have given me an opportunity with this contract to hire position. All I can ever ask for is a chance to prove myself and I really appreciate them giving me this chance.</p>

<li>Gary Vaynerchuk</li>

<p>I had no idea who Gary Vaynerchuk was until a few days ago. I recently subscribed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctXZhXmG-kf3tlIXgVZUlw">his YouTube channel</a> and am now a huge fan. He can be a little rough with his language, but I like how passionate he is when me talks, and he is a great source of inspiration to work hard and hustle. I am grateful that he has dedicated so much of his time to making videos and giving talks because I am now benefiting from all of his hard work.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
