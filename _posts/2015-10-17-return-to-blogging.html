<p>I made a commitment to blog more frequently and did not follow through. It has been over two months since my last post. I am going to try and figure out why I broke my commitment and then write about what I plan to do moving forward.</p>

<h4>Why I Think I Stopped</h4>

<p>I did not get the full time position at Codecademy. After interviewing with different members of the team, they felt that I would not be a great culture fit their because they could not offer an engineering role that they felt that I wanted. This was very demoralizing. Both co-founders commented that they had read my recent blog posts prior to our interview, so I kind of felt like my blog had worked against me. Instead of being a tool that would help me land a job in tech, it was used to disqualify me. I know I should have written a blog post at the time describing my feelings and analyzing if they were correct and I was too willing to settle for a job that I didn't want just for a steady paycheck. I couldn't bring myself to write the post, and it was probably a good thing because I was pretty bitter at the time and may have said some things I would regret today.</p>

<p>Another problem I ran into with trying to keep this commitment was that I did not set aside a specific period of time each week to write the blog. As a result, I would procrastinate and then spend far too much time writing a single post. The whole point of this project in the first place was to get better at translating my thoughts into words without spending hours organizing them.</p>

<h4>My New Plan</h4>

<p>I am going to set a time one hour a week to write my reflection. This will be every Saturday morning from 7:00-8:00am. This is all the time I will allow myself to spend writing it, and I will publish whatever I have written that week even if it is not completely finished. The quality may bother me at first, but I should get better at writing, and the time constraint will make it easier for me to keep my commitment.</p>

<p>There are three things I want to focus on in every reflection moving forward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Health And Well Being</li>
  <li>Career</li>
  <li>Side Projects/Entrepreneurship</li>
</ol>

<p>I will also conclude every blog post with what I am currently most grateful for.</p>

<h4>Health And Well Being</h4>

<p>I have really neglected my health over the past year. I am currently in the worst shape of my life. I believe that the solution is simple, and that by focusing on diet and exercise I can transform from the worst shape of my life to the best shape of my life over the next 12 months.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Diet</h4>

<p>As I get older I understand the benefits of proper nutrition more and more. I have more energy, clearer thinking, and less aches and pains the better I eat. My first step in proper nutrition is to learn what foods I should be eating to feel best. This is a tricky subject because there is a lot of money spent marketing different products that claim science proves that method XYZ is best. I am going to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bulletproof-Diet-Reclaim-Upgrade/dp/162336518X">Bullet Proof Diet</a> for the next 12 months. I like Dave Asprey's technical background, the fact that his full time job is in cyber security so he doesn't need the money from book sales, and his analytical approach in which he measures everything he does. He also emphasizes that the same approach will not work for everyone and the best thing you can do is learn how to measure the effects different foods have on your body. He backs up his recommendations with scientific studies and self experimentation.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Exercise</h4>

<p>My problem with exercising has been consistency. I either get bored, or rationalize reasons why I can't/shouldn't exercise on a given day. I want to try and overcome these things by consistently exercising every morning when I first wake up, and joining sports teams or athletic clubs. I also want to start small and slowly increment the difficulty over time to build habits. Here is my plan: </p>

<li>Go for a run every weekday morning at 7:00am</li>
<li>Starting with 1 mile, add another mile to my run every 30 days</li>
<li>Do 10 push ups every morning before my run to get my blood flowing</li>
<li>Do 10 push ups every night before going to sleep</li>
<li>Add 10 push ups to my routine every month</li>
<li>Find a place to do rock climbing every Saturday.</li>

<h4>Career</h4>

<p>Now that my Codecademy contracts has finished up I need to figure out a way to make immediate income. My plan is to reach out to recruiters, update my job board searches, and attend meetups in Philadelphia to find a local developer position. Full time or contract work is good at this point. I am not picky about the industry because I don't think I have enough experience to be picky. I want to be put in a position with a good mentor and the ability to learn and grow as a software engineer more than anything else. Something analytical would also be a huge plus.</p>

<p>I will continue to develop my skills as a developer by writing code every day, reading code, and study software architecture.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Write Code</h4>

<p>The main side project I want to focus on right now is to build a program that makes it easy for me to compare football players stats to help me set my Daily Fantasy Lineups. I just recently started working on this project and am in the process of building my database of statistics. Designing the scheme for this database has been the biggest challenge so far, but I think I can have most of the data I need within a week after returning from Ireland.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Read Code/Study Architecture</h4>

<p>This gets lumped together for now because I am currently working my way through <a href="#">Rebuilding Rails</a> and it combines both of these things. I am reading through the Rails code base as we build out different features, and gaining a better understanding of the types of problems the framework solves, how they solve them, and the differences between the ruby framework I am building.</p>

<h4>Side Projects/Entrepreneurship</h4>

<p>I described my current side project above. My hope is that I can build a tool that I like to use, and then offer it as a service for other Daily Fantasy players. Right now, there are not a lot of really good tools out there. This is most likely because the Daily Fantasy Sports industry is relatively new, and the NFL season is also seasonal. I feel like the tools that do currently exist give you projections, rankings, floors, and ceilings based on their analytical results, but do not really tell you how they came up with those projections, why they should be trusted, and provide you a way to come to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>There is a part of me that thinks that most Daily Fantasy players just want this kind of information and have no interest in doing any type of analyzing on their own. They want to be told who is a good bet, maybe a brief description of why (favorable matchup, injury, etc..) and be able to tell their friends they made a "smart" pick. I also believe that these services become less valuable the more popular they become. If everyone is working from the same recommendations than they will essentially have the same lineups, which will automatically disqualify them from the bigger guaranteed prize pools where being original and getting lucky is rewarded. It is too early for me to tell which theory makes more sense, but as long as I build a tool that I would like to use, then I consider that a win. Plus it is also a nice portfolio piece that I will send to DraftKings and FanDuel which will hopefully help me land a developer job with one of them.</p>

<h4>Gratitude</h4>

<p>I am currently most grateful for this vacation in Ireland with my family. It has been awhile since we all went on a vacation together, and it may be the last time we do this for another long while. My mom has really been enjoying herself, and I don't think we could've gotten her a better gift for her 60th birthday.</p>
