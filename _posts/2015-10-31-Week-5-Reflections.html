<p>My thoughts and reflections over the past week.</p>

<h4>Health And Well Being</h4>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Diet and Exercise</h4>

<p>This week I continued to cut back on the amount of junk food I was eating, and doing push-ups every morning when I wake up. I did not do any running or any other type of cardio however. This week I am going to do cardio exercise at least 3 days.</p>

<p>I finished the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bulletproof-Diet-Reclaim-Upgrade/dp/162336518X">Bullet Proof Diet</a>, and it was an interesting read. Dave Asprey really micromanages not only the types of foods he is eating, but where they come from, how they are prepared, and what time of the day to eat them. I don't see myself religiously following his guidelines, but I do want to change my diet to follow his recommendation of a high fat (healthy fat) low carbs with lots of vegetables. I also want to start drinking his Bullet Proof Coffee. My hesitation is that it is a lot of up front cost to get the coffee, and the food is also not cheap, so without any form of income right now I am not sure what to do. As I write this, I realize that I am procrastinating eating healthy and am going to buy the coffee as soon as I finish this blog post, and make a meal plan for this week.</p>

<h4>Career</h4>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Job Search</h4>

<p>I ventured into Philly one day this week. I met with Angel Rivera of <a href="http://point.io/">Point.io</a> and had a really good experience. It wasn't really an interview, but more of a get-to-know each other kind of thing and I really like Angel a lot. He is a cool dude with an interesting back story and is very involved within the Philadelphia tech scene and mentoring young programmers. They are just beginning to think about building out some teams, and I can't tell if he was interested in bringing me in for an interview after they figure out exactly what they are doing, but either way it was great to meet him, and I feel like I have a connection into the Philadelphia tech scene now.</p>

<p>I attended one Meetup this week <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Software-as-Craft-Philadelphia/events/226061798/">Interviewing For Software Crafters</a> and it was great. I met some students that are currently attending <a href="http://nycda.com/">New York Code & Design Academy</a> as well as learned some great strategies for interviewing. I need to go to as many meetups as possible as everyone has been beneficial and the Philly Tech scene is really friendly.</p>

<p>I have submitted a job application for <a href="http://www.cybercoders.com/web-developer-national-sports-organization-world-renown-job-221286?jobId=PM2-1227381&ad=ziprecruiter">Rails Sports Network</a>, and was introduced to a gentleman from <a href="http://www.weblinc.com/">Weblinc</a> who passed my resume along to their hiring managers. These are both Rails positions, so I would be excited to interview for either of them. I also just came across a job posting in the <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/">Technical.ly</a> newsletter for a Junior Developer position at <a href="http://www.sig.com/">Susquehanna International Group</a> (SIG). I am very excited to pursue this opportunity this week.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Write Code</h4>

<p>Once again I did not write that much code this week. This needs to change. I am going to write some code every day this week. I am definitely going to check out <a href="https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer">Rails Composer</a> and finding little small projects I can build and add to my portfolio. In particular, I think I am going to try and build a Bitcoin trading application, or something similar because of my interest in the SIG position mentioned above. I am also going to complete my Ruby web framework that I began over a month ago.</p>

<h4 class="subheading">Read Code/Study Architecture</h4>

<p>I answered all of the questions in  <a href="http://www.toptal.com/resources"> Toptal's Rails Resources</a> <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails#hiring-guide">Hiring Guide</a>. Currently these answers are in a Google Document, but I may try to turn them into one or two blog posts. I'm just not sure the best way to do that right now. This week I want to work through <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/interview-questions">Interview Questions</a>, <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/top-10-mistakes-that-rails-programmers-make">Common Mistakes</a>, and <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/tips-and-practices">Tips and Practices</a>. I am learning a lot about Rails through this process and it is really going to help me on my Rails interviews.</p>

<h4>Side Project/Entreprenurship</h4>

<p>I haven't been working too much on my side projects. I don't plan on spending too much time this week either. My job search and building projects to help prepare for the positions I am applying for are taking priority right now. If I have time I would love to work on the DFF side project more. At the very least, I want to push the code that I currently have up to GitHub.</p>

<h4>Book of The Week</h4>

<p>Book of the week was a success last week! I want to keep this trend going. This week's book is a lot more challenging. I want to read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>. I volunteered to mentor at <a href="https://chehacks.com/">CHE Hacks</a> on November 7th-8th and I want to improve my understanding of JavaScript before then. I will complete at least part 1 of the book this week, but I am going to try to put aside time every day to hopefully complete Part 2 as well.</p>

<h4>Gratitude</h4>

<p>I am currently most grateful for my friend Lonnie. He is the only web developer I knew before going to Dev Bootcamp, and has been extremely supportive throughout my entire journey. This week he met a developer at <a href="http://www.weblinc.com/">Weblinc</a> and passed along my information because they are hiring Rails Developers. It was one of many really nice things that he has done for me and I am just really appreciative of that.</p>
