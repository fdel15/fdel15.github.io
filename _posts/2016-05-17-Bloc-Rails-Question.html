<p>Hey Student,</p>

<p>It is good to hear that you are starting to understand associations. The best way to try and wrap your head around associations is by looking at examples. Let's start by setting up a scenario we want to model using associations.  </p>

<p>In our example, you have a very simple blog. You write each blog post, and each blog post has one image.</p>

User has many posts, post has 1 user
posts has many images, image belongs to a post.
