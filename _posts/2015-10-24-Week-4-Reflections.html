<p>My thoughts and reflections over the past week.</p>

<h4>Health And Well Being</h4>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Diet and Exercise</h4>

<p>The good news is that I have been eating healthier this week. I have been eating an apple every morning for breakfast, drinking a cup of green tea most days, and not eating after 9:00pm to cut down on snacking because I'm bored. I still don't really have any kind of plan, and I have not bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bulletproof-Diet-Reclaim-Upgrade/dp/162336518X">Bullet Proof Diet</a> book yet. I just fixed this by buying it right now mid blog post, so my goal this week is to read it and develop a strategy.</p>

<p>I have been slightly exercising more. I have been doing a good job of doing 10 push ups every morning when I wake up. In a few more weeks I am hoping that this will be a habit ingrained in my subconscious. I have not done any running yet. I used the reason that I need new running sneakers to procrastinate this week. I will go for my first run Monday morning, or maybe Monday afternoon depending on what time I need to take my grandfather to the doctor that morning. I also found a jump rope when cleaning my room this week, so mixing in some days of jump rope instead of running is something I want to experiment with this week.</p>

<h4>Career</h4>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Job Search</h4>

<p>I registered for a bunch of Philly Tech meetups this week to start getting involved in the community. I went to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Technically-Philly/events/225064996/">Start.Stay.Grow Summit</a> on Wednesday and I was able to connect with one of the leader's of <a href="http://openaccessphilly.com/">Open Access Philly</a>. He has already helped get me a job interview next week, and has given me a ton of resources I still need to look through on how to get involved in the Philadelphia Tech/Entrepreneurship community. It was definitely a beneficial Meetup and I need to go to more. I am planning on going to the first ever <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CodeNewbie-Philly/events/225243553/">Philly Code Newbie</a> meetup today.</p>

<p>I am also going to submit an application for this <a href="http://www.cybercoders.com/web-developer-national-sports-organization-world-renown-job-221286?jobId=PM2-1227381&ad=ziprecruiter">Rails Sports Network</a> job and <a href="https://www.themuse.com/jobs/ted/backend-engineer">backend Rails Developer Position at TED</a>.</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">Write Code</h4>

<p>I did not write as much code as I could have this week. I worked a little bit on my Fantasy Football side project, but it is still a long way from being finished. I want to check out <a href="https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer">Rails Composer</a> this upcoming week after hearing about it on a <a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">Ruby Rogue</a> podcast yesterday.</p>

<h4 class="subheading">Read Code/Study Architecture</h4>

<p>My plan for code study this week is to go through <a href="http://www.toptal.com/resources"> Toptal's Rails Resources</a>. I am going to go through their <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails#hiring-guide">Hiring Guide</a>, <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/interview-questions">Interview Questions</a>, <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/top-10-mistakes-that-rails-programmers-make">Common Mistakes</a>, and <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/tips-and-practices">Tips and Practices</a>. This will give me plenty of material to write several Rails blog posts this week.</p>

<h4>Side Project/Entreprenurship</h4>

<p>I want to finish an MVC for my DFF tool this week. To finish it up, I need to build views for the search results, add CSS and JavaScript to make the design look better, and build out views for Team pages. If I work a few ours a day on this, I should be able to complete all of these tasks this week. I really want to get this in front of people to demo and then I can add or subtract features based on feedback.</p>

<h4>Book of The Week</h4>

<p>The book I want to read this week is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bulletproof-Diet-Reclaim-Upgrade/dp/162336518X">Bullet Proof Diet</a>. I mentioned above my reasons why I want to read this book. I will have this completed by next blog post.</p>

<h4>Gratitude</h4>

<p>I am currently most grateful for the tech community leaders in Philadelphia. One of the reasons why I wanted to live in NYC instead of Philadelphia was because I thought Philly didn't have a robust entrepreneurship/tech community but I was thankfully wrong. It is smaller than New York's meetup scene, but this is a good thing because it means I will have more of an opportunity to impact and grow it.</p>
