<p>Hey Student,</p>

<p>You are experiencing a very common area of confusion in Javascript, which are closures.</p>

<p>Overall, your code looks pretty good. All of your buttons are responding to clicks which is awesome. So why are we getting "undefined"?</p>

<p>I am going to give you two clues which will hopefully point you in the right direction.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In your preferred web browser, use the developer tools to open up a Javascript console. Recreate your prizes variable:</p>

    <div class="code-example">var prizes = ["A Unicorn!", "A Hug!", "Fresh Laundry!"]</div>

    <p>How many elements are in your array?</p>

    <p>What happens if you type prizes[3]?</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Use the "debugger" keyword to pause your program when you click on a button. When your program is paused, do some exploration.</p>

    <p>What is the value of prizes?</p>

    <p>What is the value of btnNum?</p>

    <p>(If you are not sure how to use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_debugging.asp">debugger</a> or what it is, please reach out as it is an essential tool for Javascript development!)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These two steps should help get you unstuck, and working towards a correct solution.</p>

<p>Here is some more information on Javascript closures that you may find useful. It will probably make more sense if you read the documentation after doing the steps above.</p>
