            <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Bar Roulette: </span>Hackathon project built in 24 hours using Rails, MongoDB, YelpAPI, and UberAPI.<br><br>

            Bar Roulette is an application to make bar hopping easier and more fun. It takes your current location and using the YelpAPI randomly returns a bar within a 5 mile radius. Using the UberAPI you can then arrange to have a car come pick you up with the click of a button, or you can search again to return a different bar.<br><br>

            My role was to help configure Rails using MongoDB as our database, and set up the YelpAPI and UberAPI.</p></a>
