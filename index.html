        The purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework. Rulers on Rails is designed to work as a simpler version of Rails. By using similar design patterns found in the Rails framework, I now have a better understanding about how a lot of Rails "magic" works, and why it works the way it does.</p>

      Bar Roulette is an application to make bar hopping easier and more fun. It takes your current location and using the YelpAPI randomly returns a bar within a 5 mile radius. Using the UberAPI you can then arrange to have a car come pick you up with the click of a button, or you can search again to return a different bar.<br><br>

      My role was to help configure Rails using MongoDB as our database, and set up the YelpAPI and UberAPI.</p></a>
