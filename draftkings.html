    <h1 style="text-align: center">League's Weekly Lineup Lineup</h1>

    <jumbotron><a href="https://www.draftkings.com/r/fdel15"><img src="img/draftkings-logo.jpg"></a></jumbotron>

    <h3 style="text-align: center">Each week the league will have a lineup in DraftKings Million Dollar Guarantee.</h3>
    <h4 class="instructions">How it works</h4>

    <p>I will choose at least one league manager each week to pick a line-up. I will give them the log in credentials to my DraftKing's account and provide the funds for the entry fee. The prize money won will be split between the league manager who picked the team and the rest of the league. The details will be listed below. </p>

    <h4 class="instructions">How the league manager will be chosen</h4>

    <p>I don't really have a system for how to choose the league manager each week. Ideally, I will think of a clever competition each week but I may just choose an eligible team manager at random if I don't think of anything. For the first week there will be two managers:
      <li>Matt for hosting the draft at his house</li>
      <li>The league manager who comes up with the funniest team name</li>
    </p>

    <h4 class="instructions">How will the prize money be distributed</h4>

    <p>If the league manager cashes for prize money, it will be distributed in this order:</p>

    <li>The DraftKings entry fee will go back into the account to fund next week's lineup</li>
    <li>The next $600 goes to the league manager and is equivalent to the possible max prize money that can be won in our league.</li>
    <li>Every dollar after $600 will be split: 50% to league manager, 50% to a league fund</li>

    <p>How the league fund money is spent will be determined later depending on the balance but possibilities include sponsoring next year's draft (something like Dave & Busters), cash payouts to eligible league members, league group event (Eagle's tickets or something), some type of competition etc...</p>

    <h4 class="instructions">What is an eligible league member</h4>

    <p>Right now there are two requirements to being an eligible league member:
      <li>Pay the $50 league entry fee</li>
      <li>Show up to the last league event (the draft)</li>
    </p>

    <p>These requirements may change in the future. If you are not an eligible league member by the time lineups are locked for the 1:00pm Sunday kickoffs then you are not eligible for any league funds won that week.</p>

    <h4 class="instructions">How will funds be distributed to winners</h4>
    <p><a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a></p>

    <p>If you do not have Venmo I highly recommend you get it. If for some reason you can't except anything but cash then you will probably have to wait a long time for me to actually get the cash.</p>
