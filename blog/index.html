        <p class="title">IDs, Classes, And Best Practices</p>
        <p class="preview">When learning CSS I found myself asking what the heck is a class, an ID, and why should I care? In this blog post I am going to expalin the difference between ID's, Classes, and when you should use each...<a href="t2-css-design.html">read more</a></p>

      <p class="title">Kitchen vs Table</p>
        <p class="preview">I love how Dev Bootcamp treats each cohort as its own individual experiment. Unlike a lot of educational programs and institutions today, they are not afraid to admit that they do not have things figured out. Their curriculum is constantly evolving, and there is not a perfect way to teach everyone...<a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">read more</a></p>

        <p class="title">Version Control, Git, and GitHub</p>

        <p class="title"> Thinking Style </p>
        <p class ="preview">My thinking style kind of contradicts itself. I like having access to experts or references and being placed in a stimulating environment, but at the same time I also learn best by working alone. It oddly makes sense to me because what drew me to DBC was the stimulating environment and expert instructors, and one of the reasons why I wanted to become a programmer was because of my belief that they normally are left to their own to complete work.<a href="c3_thinking-style.html">read more...</a></p>

        <p class="title"> Group_by Method </p>
        <p class ="preview"> In simplest terms, the group_by method breaks a collection into groups based on some given criteria. It expects to accept a bock that contains the criteria by which the items in the collection will be grouped. If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead. <a href="./t4-enumerable-methods.html">...read more</a></p>
        <p class="title">Tech Industry: Diversty Is A Problem>
        <p class="preview">One of the big problems facing the Tech Industry today is the lack of diversity in the work force. The stereotypes say that Silicon Valley (and the tech industry as a whole is made up entirely of white males. Unfortunately, the data supports this stereotype.<a href="c4-tech-issues.html">...Read More</a></p>
