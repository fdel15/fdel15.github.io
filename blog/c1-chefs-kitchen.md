Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs Table

09/20/2014

I love how Dev Bootcamp treats each cohort as its own individual experiment. Unlike a lot of educational programs and institutions today, they are not afraid to admit that they do not have things figured out. Their curriculum is constantly evolving, and there is not a perfect way to teach everyone.

My favorite part about Dev Bootcamp is that they treat the students as adults, and expect us to come in with a Kitchen Mindset. We are not entitled to any sort of experience, and Dev Bootcamp is not some prepackaged software that you can pick off the shelf. I believe it is my responsibility to control my experience in every aspect of my life and that perception is reality. This type of mindset empowers me to live life to the fullest, and I am excited to be immersed in a program that adopts this same sort of mentality.

As excited as I am to join this type of community, I am also very nervous. The idea of pair programming freightens me because I have imposter syndrome. I put a lot of pressure on myself in life to be a strong co-worker, teamate, friend, sibiling etc. I know going in that there are going to be challenges and situations that I struggle with and I am going to feel guilty that I am letting my pairing partner down. I haven't even had a chance to pair program yet, but I already have this fear not to become the weak link that noone wants to pair with. In a way this is good, because it motivates me to study more and try harder, but this pressure and anxiety I put on myself is not healthy in the long run.

One thing for sure is that I am walking into Dev Bootcamp hungry, mad and inspired. This program is me taking control of my career and my future. I am very happy to be a part of DBC and I cannot wait to co-create a magical experience with my cohort.
