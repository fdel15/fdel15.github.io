        <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3> <!--Title Of Blog Post -->

        <p class="date">October 26th, 2014</p> <!--Date -->

       <p>I had never heard of the term Stereotype Threat until this week’s blog challenge. After doing some research and reading about Stereotype Threats, I am not sure if I ever directly experienced a Stereotype Threat. I believe this is because I do not have a strong identification with any particular Social Identity</p>

      <p>Social Identity can be defined as the part of personal identity, our sense of who we are, that comes from our group memberships and social categories to which we belong. Some examples are our age, sex, race, religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, orientation, region, social class, ideological persuasion, political affiliation, and mental health status.</p>

      <p>I am a 27 year old, white male, who was raised Catholic (I no longer identity with any particular religion), aspiring programmer, Italian-Irish-Polish American, straight, grew up in a middle class family in South Jersey, independent, and have not been diagnosed with any mental health issues. But I do not identify myself with any of those particular traits. I have no strong emotional connection with any of these things about myself and view them as simply facts in much the same way I view 2+2 = 4. Just reading that first sentence about myself out loud sounds strange and weird. </p>

      <p>A Stereotype Threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one’s group. One of the main examples I saw repeatedly in my research is that women are not good at Math. Experiments show that women do worse on standardized tests because of this stereotypes.</p>

      <p>I have mixed feelings about this stereotype threat based on my personal life experiences. I think you can try and prove that this is true by looking at the number of engineers, programmers, mathematicians, and other quantitatively based fields and say that because there are less women in these professions women are less interested in pursuing these types of careers based on this stereotype. </p>

      <p>However, when I was earning my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics, there was at least a 2:1 ratio of females to males in all of my advanced Mathematics classes. The best students in every class had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with how much effort was put into understanding abstract concepts outside of the classroom. What I found really interesting though, was that I only met one or two girls in my math classes that did not intend to teach K-12 math after graduation. In my own personal life experience, I have not found that females identify themselves as being bad at math (to be fair the most common reaction from both males and females when I say I have a math degree is “Oh I am terrible at math”) but they have a stronger desire to teach and work with kids rather than pursue a quantitative career.</p>

      <p>The most common example I came across in my research is that before a test they would tell a particular group that they were going to do poorly on a test. If simply saying this before a test causes them to perform worst, then shouldn’t saying the opposite cause them to perform better? If so, then the solution to these types of problems have to do with understanding the root cause of them.</p>

      <p>I use to tutor high school students in math and one of the most common limiting beliefs they had was “I am terrible at math.” My first question would always be terrible at math compared to who? Compared to Einstein, yeah you don’t really know that much bout Math, but compared to a 1st grader you are a genius when it comes to Math. Both comparisons are ridiculous, so it’s not that you are terrible at Math you just do not know as much as you think you should. The next thing I would do is get specific about exactly what they were struggling with. When we got specific, we could change the “I am terrible at Math” belief to something like “I am terrible at fractions” we had something concrete that we could work on and improve.</p>

      <p>I believe that Stereotype Threats are just an example of a self limiting belief. If they appear in the workplace, I think the important thing to do is to ask a lot of questions to understand the belief as much as possible. Understand where it comes from, and specifically what the limiting belief is. Then you can come up with counter examples to this belief that currently exist as well as focus on a particular tangible skill that can be improved with effort to eliminate the belief completely. </p> <!--Blog Post Content -->
