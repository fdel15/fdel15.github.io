        <h3>Recruitifi — My First Job Interview As A Web Developer
</h3> <!--Title Of Blog Post -->

        <p class="date">February 12th, 2015</p> <!--Date -->

        <p>
          It had to happen eventually. When I decided to switch careers from a sales rep to a web developer, I knew that at some point I would be interviewing for my first job as a web developer. I am happy to have landed my first interview only a week after graduation from Dev Bootcamp, and even though I won’t know for a couple of days if they decide to hire me or not, I feel that it is a good idea to document my experience. My goal is to learn from every job interview so that as I continue applying for jobs, I get stronger as a developer and potential employee. Hopefully this will lead me to landing a job sooner rather than later. </p>

<h4>The Company</h4>

<p>The company I interviewed for is Recruitifi. They are a startup company based in New York, that was founded about 18 months ago. Their goal is to use technology to transform the Recruiting industry. Recruitfi is also an employer partner of Dev Bootcamp. The CEO of the company, Justin, as well as the CTO, Chad, attended our DBC final project demonstrations. They emailed me the Monday after our presentation, which lead to a phone call, which lead to a coding challenge, which lead to my first interview. They are currently in the process of expanding their technology team. They are looking to bring on 4 new developers. Either 2 senior and 2 junior developers, or 1 senior and 3 junior developers.</p>

<h4>What I Like About Recruitifi</h4>

<p>It was nice to be contacted directly by the company for a potential job based on a presentation instead of having to submit my resume and pray to God that someone liked my choice of font or had something else stand out enough to warrant them reaching out and offering an interview. I was also really impressed with both Justin and Chad during the brief amount of time I got to chat with them after our presentations. They both came across as extremely friendly and intelligent, and were able to articulate their vision for Recruitifi really well.</p>

<p>I like the size of the company. They currently have 17 employees and one of the things that first attracted me to web development was the opportunity to join small growing startups. I really like their business strategy. The Recruitment industry is a (xx billion) dollar a year industry, and it took me about 60 seconds to understand their vision and see the potential benefits for disrupting this industry.</p>

<h4>The Interview</h4>

<p>The plan was for me to meet with Chad and review the coding challenge that I discuss in this <a href="Rack-Middleware.html">blog post</a>. I opted to meet Chad at their office in Midtown, instead of doing the interview over Google Hangout, which was a great decision even though it meant I had to travel 6 hours round trip from New Jersey. Meeting in person was the right decision because I got to see their work space first hand ( they are currently operating out of a shared workplace while they wait for their floor in the same building to be ready ) and meet other members on the team besides Chad.</p>

<p>Overall, it lasted for about two hours. In the first part Chad and I were drawing on the whiteboard and discussing Rack and exactly what Middleware is and isn’t. Then we reviewed the code I had submitted for the challenge. Next, I got to meet Sam, who is the Product Manager, and we spoke for about half an hour. I feel like this may have been the behavior part of the interview, and Sam was asking questions to see if I would be a good fit for the team. Then I met with Chad again to discuss any questions I may have, and talk about the plans for Recruitifi going forward.</p>

<h4>What I Think I Did Well</h4>

<p>The whole process was a really fun experience for me. I like the fact that I arrived about 5 minutes early, and was able to figure out the process of checking in on the 16th floor to unlock the 8th floor ( where Recruitify was stationed ). I was very engaged with our discussion about Rack and Middleware. I like the fact that I had prepared well enough during the coding challenge to join in on the discussion and follow Chad’s logic as he explained concepts to me. Every time I was confused, I asked questions, and I didn’t pretend to understand things that were over my head. I asked questions about everything from Rack, to Middleware, to RSpec, to certain design decisions he recommended and why. Hopefully this conveyed that as a Junior Engineer, I do not know everything, but I am teachable and enthusiastic to learn new things.</p>

<p>I enjoyed speaking with the Product Manager, Sam. We were able to connect on the fact that we both studied abroad in Australia for a semester. I was able to bring up my Math background in the context of our conversation which seemed to add value to me as a potential employee. I also think I did a fairly decent job of talking about myself and my previous experiences working and coding, which can really be a struggle for me sometimes. I was also pleased with the fact that I went through Recruitifi’s website, and FAQ’s, and was prepared to discuss exactly what their product does and who it is for.</p>

<h4>What I Think I Can Approve On</h4>

<p>When we were white boarding together, Chad did most of the writing and talking while I followed along and pointed at his illustrations and commented on it. I think I should have been more active in actually writing on the whiteboard. I know this is not currently one of my strengths, which was probably why I was comfortable following along and talking more than writing, but it probably would have been more beneficial to try and show what I already knew instead of just telling him.</p>

<p>My code for the coding challenge was wrong. I did not create a middleware application. Instead, I created a Rack application that would display a random quote. The main reason this happened was because I could not figure out how to access the text file in fixtures without explicitly hard coding it in. It turns out, that I should have turned it into a GemFile and required it, which made me realize that I have never written a Gemfile before. I will soon have a blog post discussing my first experience building a gem file and what I learned during the process. I also realize that I really need to brush up on my Ruby and Rail skills in general.</p>

<p>I didn’t have enough questions about the job being offered. When it came to asking questions about the code, I was comfortable because it flowed with the conversation and my natural curiosity kind of took over. Every time Chad asked me if I had any discussions about Recruitifi, or as I know probably realize, the position I was applying for, I couldn’t think of anything. I worry that this may be considered some sort of red flag that I did not prepare well enough, or did not seriously consider this position before showing up.</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, I knew beyond a doubt that this was a place that I would like to work if the offer was reasonable. I feel like I didn’t express this enough before I left. I should have been more assertive that I really liked their team, and would love to work for them. I think if they are on the fence of whether or not I would be a good fit, this type of assertiveness could be enough to sway them in my favor.</p>

<p>I also never mentioned the fact that I organized DBC::NYC’s first Hackathon. I was never able to work this into the conversation. I am not sure how to bring it up without sounding like I just love talking about myself. It is probably worth mentioning in future interviews just because it shows that I take initiative and know how to execute rather than just tell them I work hard.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>When the interview ended, Chad told me he would let me know by Friday what their decision would be. I have absolutely no idea where which direction he is leaning. From what he said, he was going to talk to Sam, and then as a team they would decide if I would be a good fit for the company. I am trying to be optimistic about my chances of getting this job, but the likelihood of getting an offer from my first interview is probably unlikely. I am in the state of mind of hoping for the best but prepared for the worst, and even in the worst case scenario, at least I am aware of which aspects of Ruby I need to study more.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
