        <h3>Exploring My Values</h3> <!--Title Of Blog Post -->

        <p class="date">November 2nd, 2014</p> <!--Date -->

        <p>The last time I felt happiest, proudest and most satisfied the following values came to mind: </p>

        <p>Accomplishment. I remember having a strong feeling of Accomplishment. I had set a goal for myself that at one point did not seem realistic or even feasible, and through persistence and handwork I achieved my goal and it was a wonderful feeling of Accomplishment. </p>

        <p>Enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is one of the most underrated feelings. Enthusiasm creates energy, sparks creativity, and is extremely contagious. I love being around enthusiastic people so I try as much as possible to display enthusiasm on a consistent basis. </p>

        <p>Reputation. There is a famous quote that goes something like, reputation takes a lifetime to build and only a few minutes to completely destroy. I try to keep this in mind every day. I believe you are only as good as your reputation and try to keep in mind how fragile it is when making decisions or interacting with other people.</p>

        <p>Competition. I love competition because it is the ultimate motivator. I enjoy surrounding myself with other people who are going to push me to be better and work harder. </p>

        <p>Honesty. Honesty is extremely important to me. When in doubt, always tell the truth. Mistakes are inevitable in life, but people are always more willing to forgive you for your mistakes if you can admit to them, apologize, and promise to learn from them. You have to be honest with yourself as well as with others. </p>

        <p>In general I do try to live up to these values. I would rate my ability to live up to each one a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. </p>

        <p>The last topic that someone asked my advice on was my little sister who wanted to go back to college. I am the only one in my family that currently has a college degree and we talked about what kind of degree she should focus on, how to balance work and school, and finding a career that you will enjoy in life. </p>

        <p>When I think about my values I feel pretty good about them. I am not sure how they will  help me mediate a stereotype threat if I recognize it. I think Reputation will help me more than the other values I have mentioned in this post because I consider my self a kind, caring, and fair person and I would like other people to view me the same way. If i recognize a stereotype threat I would want to confront it to make sure everyone was being treated fairly.</p>

        <p>One exercise that may help when feeling down is mediation. i have recently begun meditating every day after reading about many health benefits this sort of mind exercise can have for you that have been scientifically proven.</p>

        <p>That is all I have for right now regarding my values. Thanks for reading.</p> <!--Blog Post Content -->
