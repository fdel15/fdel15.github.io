        <h3>Deep Thoughts</h3> <!--Title Of Blog Post -->

        <p class="date">January 30th, 2015</p> <!--Date -->

<p>1.  A good way to keep a mob of peasants from killing your monster is when they break into your castle, make them be real quiet, then open a door and there's the monster, sound asleep. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p></p>
<p>2.  A man doesn't automatically get my respect. He has to get down in the dirt and beg for it. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>3.  After I die, wherever my spirit goes, I'm going to try to get back and visit my skeleton at least once a year, because, "Hey, old buddy, how's it going?" -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>4.  Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus's-flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>5.  Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what IS that thing?! -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>6.  Can't the Marx Brothers be arrested and maybe even tortured for all the confusion and problems they've caused? -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>7.  Children need encouragement. So if a kid gets an answer right, tell him it was a lucky guess. That way, he develops a good, lucky feeling. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>8.  Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>9.  Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>10. Despair is like a cable that is buried just under the surface of the ground. You pull it up and pull it up, but that cable just keeps right on going, clear across a field, until you come to a bunch of guys who are burying the cable. Then just walk up to them and go, "Hey, have you seen Fred?" And they'll say, "Fred who?" And you say, "Fred of snakes?" Then cover your ears, because big laughs are coming. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>11. Do you know what happens when you slice a golf ball in half? Someone gets mad at you. I found this out the hard way. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>12. Even though he was an enemy of mine, I had to admit that what he had accomplished was a brilliant piece of strategy. First, he punched me, then he kicked me, then he punched me again. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>13. For mad scientists who keep brains in jars, here's a tip: Why not add a slice of lemon to each jar, for freshness. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>14. Happiness is not a circus clown rolling around in a big tractor tire so that his arms and legs form "spokes." Happiness is when he stops. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>15. He was a cowboy, mister, and he loved the land. He loved it so much he made a woman out of dirt and married her. But when he kissed her, she disintegrated. Later, at the funeral, when the preacher said, "Dust to dust," some people laughed, and the cowboy shot them. At his hanging, he told the others, "I'll be waiting for you in heaven---with a gun." -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>16. Here's a good gag if you go swimming in a swamp and when you com out you're all covered with leeches. Just say, "Hey, has anybody seen my raisins?" (Because leeches kind of look like big raisins.) -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>17. Here's a good joke to do during an earthquake: Straddle a big crack in the ground, and if it opens wider, go "Whoa! Whoa!" and flail your arms around, like you're going to fall in. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>18. Here's a good thing to do if you go to a party and you don't know anybody: First, take out the garbage. Then go around and collect any extra garbage that people might have, like a crumpled-up napkin, and take that out too. Pretty soon people will want to meet the busy garbage guy. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>19. How come the dove gets to be the peace symbol? How about the pillow? It has more feathers than the dove, and it doesn't have that dangerous beak. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
<p>20. I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex. -- Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey</p>
