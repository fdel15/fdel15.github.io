    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <div id="content">
      <p>Pairing with other young developers is one of the thing that all of the cohorts seemed to mutually fear when coming into DBC. Most of us had never had never paired programmed before and we were afraid of the unkown. <br><br>

        I am very happy to say that each of my pairing sessions have been great so far. I have come to realize that everybody in DBC is extremely intelligent and I am learning so much from each person I pair with.
<br><br>
        The fun part of pairing is how quickly time flies by while the session is going on. When I am working alone on a challenge it is easy to get stuck, frustrated and feel hopeless. When working with a partner and being forced to talk through your thought process and having someone to bounce ideas off of, and it makes programming more enjoyable. <br><br>

        There are two things that frustrate me/are difficult about pairing so far. The first thing is setting up pairing sessions. Ideally it would be great to pair with people that are in my cohort but it is tough to know what everyone's schedule is. The other thing that I find difficult is trying to verbally express my thought process. There are many times during each pairing session that I struggle to articulate the thoughts that are in my head.<br><br>

        After reading the feedback I received I have to say I am generally pleased with the overall results. I am happy to hear that my pairing partners seem to have enjoyed my company as much as I have enjoyed theirs. All of my feedback as been pretty positive so I am just going to stick with my strategy of going into each sessions with a positive attitude and putting an emphasis on listening. <br><br>

        Writing feedback has been a learning process for me. My initial meta feedback on this show that I have had a hard time making my feedback specific and actionable. I have a hard time criticizing anyone I work with. I think I feel rude or mean if I try to make constructive criticism and it is much easier to point out the things that went really well that I enjoyed during our session. I guess that makes me a shit sandwhich server and it is something I will continue to work on.
        <br><br>

        Overall I am extremely happy with the entire pairing process. I think it makes coding more enjoyable and productive. I am really happy that DBC makes us pair program during Phase0 to get us over our fear of the unknown before our cohorts begin. I love that we receive feedback on everything we do at DBC because it is impossible to learn without feedback. I always want to know what I did right, what I did wrong, and most importantly why. The annonymous structure of the feedback system allows people to be more honest than they typically would be. <br><br>

        Thats all I got for this blog post. Thanks for reading.
