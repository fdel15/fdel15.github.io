    <h3>Thinking Style</h3>

      <p>My preferred thinking style is Abstract Sequential. My exact scores were: <br> <br>

Concrete Sequential (CS) = 12 <br>
Abstract Sequential (AS) = 56 <br>
Abstract Random (AR) = 28 <br>
Concrete Random (CR) = 24 <br>
<br><br>
My thinking style kind of contradicts itself. I like having access to experts or references and being placed in a stimulating environment, but at the same time I also learn best by working alone. It oddly makes sense to me because what drew me to DBC was the stimulating environment and expert instructors, and one of the reasons why I wanted to become a programmer was because of my belief that they normally are left to their own to complete work.
<br><br>
I think as long as I am conscientious of my weaknesses, I will excel at DBC. The one that disturbs me the most is “Being forced to work with those of differing views” because I do believe that I can benefit from different viewpoints. I know I am not easily swayed but remaining open minded, kind, and embracing different view points rather than fighting them will be essential for me.

The hardest part so far in Phase 0 has been staring at a blank screen. When we had to design our own website it was really difficult for me to write the first lines of code to get the ball rolling. Once I have some momentum I am able to get in flow and progress nicely, but getting started has been extremely difficult for me.  I believe it is related to my learning style because when I am asked to be creative I do not have any sort of blueprint to follow, and I currently do not have any logical steps to take. It is more just guess and check and hope it looks nice.
<br><br>
I have been a firm believer in the growth mindset and working hard at developing this type of mindset years before I even heard of DBC. In fact, it is this type of mindset that eventually led me to finding DBC and ultimately applying. I do not belied that I am forever doomed to being an uncreative person who struggles with design. I believe that up until this point in my life I simply have not noticed design. I have already begun making a more conscientious effort to noticing the design on the websites I frequently visit. I try to map out wireframes of my favorite site to get an idea of what they must look like.
<br><br>
I think I am going to try to build some of these pages from scrap to familiarize myself with the design features they use. I will use Chrome Developer Tools to help me accomplish this. The way my learning style works, I believe that I can develop a mental blueprint for webpages based on my experience of copying and working with different designs. This mental blueprint will help me overcome my fear of the blank screen as I will be able to form logical sequential steps on what to do to get started.</p> <!-- blog post goes here -->
