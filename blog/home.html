        <h3><a href="Recruitify_Interview.html">Recruitify Interview</a></h3>

        <p class="date">February 12th, 2015</p>

        <p>It had to happen eventually. When I decided to switch careers from a sales rep to a web developer, I knew that at some point I would be interviewing for my first job as a web developer. I am happy to have landed my first interview only a week after graduation from Dev Bootcamp, and even though I won’t know for a couple of days if they decide to hire me or not, I feel that it is a good idea to document my experience. My goal is to learn from every job interview so that as I continue applying for jobs, I get stronger as a developer and potential employee. Hopefully this will lead me to landing a job sooner rather than later.....<a href="Recruitify_Interview.html">Read More</a></p>

        <h3><a href="Rack-Middleware.html">Rack Middleware</a></h3>

        <p class="date">February 9th, 2015</p>

        <p class="blog-preview">Less than a week after graduating from DBC, I had my first coding challenge as part of the interview process with a potential future employer. I was excited and eager to get started on the challenge, but my heart dropped for a second as I read over the instructions. “Create a Rack Middleware application.” I was aware of what Rack was thanks to my experience with Rails and Sinatra, and I had heard the term middleware before, but imposter syndrome quickly struck me and I thought to myself “Oh know, I have no idea how to build a middleware application.” Fortunately, after spending a few hours googling, reading some documentation, and watching a few tutorials I was able to complete the application. I wanted to write this blog post to share some of the things I learned about Rack middleware during the challenge.....<a href="Rack-Middleware.html">Read More</a></p>
