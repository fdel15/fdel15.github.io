    <h3>Conflict</h3>
    <div id="content">
      <p>This blog post is challenging for me to write. I have a laid back personality and for the most part I tend to avoid conflict, and never take little things too personally, so most of the conflicts that come to mind are too personal for me to want to share on a blog. <br><br>

The conflict I am going to discuss may sound silly, but it is the best example I can think of. Every year I organize a fantasy football league for me and my friends. We use to watch all of the Eagles games together in high school, and this league is a good excuse to get together when we can to still watch games. As the commissioner of the league, I made a mistake in the wavier wire settings, and it allowed one of the owners in the league to unfairly pick-up the most eligible free agent that week. <br><br>

It was completely my fault that this mistake happened and I knew it. I fixed the settings as soon as one of the other league owners brought it to my attention. The conflict came when I was asked to remove the player that was unfairly picked up from that person’s team. I refused. <br><br>

I felt it would be unfair to penalize another team for a mistake that I had made, especially because the mistake did not give him an unfair advantage, it simply rewarded him for being the first person to try and pick up this player. Secondly, if I removed this player from his team and put him back in waivers under the fixed settings, the player would wind up on my team because I had top priority that week. I also felt this would be unfair to do. <br><br>

I tried to explain this to my friend who didn’t think it was enough to just restore the settings. This turned into a conflict when he questioned my integrity, and said that I was ruining the integrity of the entire league. The source of this conflict is how each of us determined fairness. I thought it was unfair to punish anybody for the mistake that I had made, and he thought it was unfair to have anybody benefit from my mistake.<br><br>

At first I was angry about the personal shot at my integrity. This is a league of friends and we have all known each other since high school. It is primarily for fun as the cash prize at the end of the year is relatively small. I handled the conflict by just posting a message to the league message board. I explained that I had made a mistake, what had happened because of it, and that the process was fixed. I then explained my side of the argument about why I was not going to remove the player that was unfairly picked up, and just asked that player to voluntarily drop him if he felt like he was given an unfair advantage because of my mistake. <br><br>

My actions resolved the entire conflict as the person did voluntarily drop him after reading my message and league integrity was restored. I feel like I would have made him really angry if I just went in and changed his roster because I had the power to do so, but when it was his choice to do what he thought was fair, we avoided an entirely separate conflict. <br><br>

If I could go back, I definitely would have made sure that I never messed up the settings in the first place so we could avoid the whole conflict. I also would not have taken the integrity comment so personal, and would have tried to convince my friend who questioned my integrity to have faith that when given the chance our friends will do the right thing. I was not surprised at all when my friend dropped the player, and I wish I would have tried to express that point of view earlier. <br><br>

The main thing I learned from this experience is how to check the wavier wire settings in a Yahoo Fantasy Football league, and that you should always give people the chance to do the right thing before assuming they will do the wrong thing. <br><br>
