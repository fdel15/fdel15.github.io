        <h3>New Site Design</h3> <!--Title Of Blog Post -->

        <p class="date">November 12th, 2014</p> <!--Date -->

        <p>While I was working on our JavaScrip Cheat Sheet challenge last week, I was forced to confront the fact that my current website screamed amateur. The design was sloppy, at best, my blog posts did not link back to my site, and it was completely unresponsive. The immersive part of DBC had not even begun yet, but it was painfully obvious that no one would ever hire me as long as my personal website looked like this. I decided that I needed to do something about it immediately.</p>

        <p>My biggest challenge was overcoming my fear of design. I have always considered myself "artistically challenged". I was a straight A student my whole life in every subject, except for Art. The way my mind naturally functions, I do not notice elegant designs, cool fonts, and perfect color schemes. To overcome this fear, I signed up for a free account at <a src="http://referrals.trhou.se/frankdelpidio">teamtreehouse.com</a> and enrolled in their building a website course.</p>

        <p>The course is absolutely fantastic. Overall, it took me somewhere between 10 to 20 hours to get through all of the videos, quizzes, and code challenges. It was the perfect way to freshen up my CSS/HTML skills a week before Phase 1. We have learned Ruby, SQL, and JavaScript since covering CSS and HTML, and I was in need of this kind of refresher to help me remember the proper syntax. I will also more than likely be a Team Tree House member for life, as I cannot say enough about well structured and easy to follow their courses are. If you are interested in keeping your skills sharp for a small monthly fee, I strongly encourage you to check out a basic account at <a src"http://referrals.trhou.se/frankdelpidio">teamtreehouse.com</a></p>

        <p>My goal was to build a simple site with a clean/sharp design. I have noticed that most web developer applications require you to send a link to your personal site, so I wanted it to look professional. I wanted to be able to display my blog, my (future) portfolio, some information about me, and the best ways to contact me. I think I have absolutely nailed it on all of these goals. On top of that, I also learned how to make my site responsive (seriously play around with your browser window and watch my website morph live right before your eyes!) and it should be fairly easy to scale as I add new blog posts each week.</p>

        <p>I requested feedback from fellow DBC'ers who have commented on my blog in previous weeks. They all agreed that my site is infinitely better than what it was which was a good thing. Some other feedback that I received was that one person thought it was too boring and I should add some more color to it. I can definitely see his point, as it is mainly a white page, but I think this will change when I start adding more projects to my portfolio. Another great bit of feedback I received was that some of my images were too small to read in my blog posts, and so I made sure to resize them.</p>

        <p>I also went through the process of registering my own custom domain name, frankD.co. It's not a dot com, but my last name is fairly long and hard to spell correctly, so I decided making it shorter and having a .co would ultimately be more beneficial. I am currently in the process of pointing this domain to my GitHub pages, but the process may take up to 24 hours so we will see how this all plays out.</p>

        <p>This is my last technical blog post before moving to New York City and participating in the immersive part of DBC's curriculum. Right now it is a roller coaster of emotions. I am excited, anxious, eager, and scared. Overall I am looking forward to continuing my education and doing my best to articulate what I learn in these blog posts.</p>

        <p>As always, thanks for reading.</p> <!--Blog Post Content -->
