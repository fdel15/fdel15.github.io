category: 10ideas
---

<p>I currently have about $60,000 of debt from student loans. One of the goals when I had when I decided to make the career change to become a programmer was that I would be able to figure out a way to pay off all that debt before I turned 30. It is two months until my 28th birthday so I am running out of time.</p>

<h4>The Ideas</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Get a Full Time Development job</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>I know this one is obvious but it hasn't happened yet and is still priority number one.</li></ul>
  <li>Work on free lancing projects on the side</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li>How and where to find free lance clients can be its own ideas list in the future</li></ul>
  <li>Win hackathon prizes</li>
    <ul class="sublist"><li><a href="http://devpost.com/">DevPost</a> (formerly named Challenge Post) always has plenty of online and in person hackathons. Some have really great cash prizes.</li>
      <li>A great side effect from this strategy is that hackathons are great for networking and building a portfolio</li>
      <li>Possible future ideas list would be 10 challenge post hackathons that would be fun to enter, 10 possible problems I could solve for the hackathon that I choose to participate in, 10 possible solutions to one of the problems, and 10 ways to recruit a team to help win the hackathon</li></ul>
    <li>Tutor students learning to programming</li>
      <ul class="sublist"><li>This includes doing one or two nights a week at DBC as a coach while working a full time job</li></ul>
    <li>Build an online business</li>
      <ul class="sublist"><li>An online Shopify store with a drop business should be possible.</li>
        <li>Would be fun to do 10 ideas on products I could drop ship. It would be great to do this during Shopify's next build a business competition.</li></ul>
    <li>Dev Bootcamp referral bonuses</li>
      <ul class="sublist"><li>This isn't official yet, but it looks like they are going to offer alumni some sort of referral bonus for new students.</li></ul>
    <li>Build an iPhone app</li>
      <ul class="sublist"><a href="https://medium.com/@stuartkhall/how-i-got-2-3m-app-downloads-without-spending-a-cent-on-marketing-f4823b6bc779">This post on Medium</a> got me all excited about how you can make a nice profit if you find the right niche and tell a compelling story.</ul>
    <li>Sell an e-book based on my Bootcamp experience and market it as a helpful guide for future Bootcamp students.</li>
    <li>Create a getting started with Arduino guide</li>
      <ul class="sublist"><li>Would be a great resource for bootcamp graduates trying to learn a new skill beyond web development</li>
