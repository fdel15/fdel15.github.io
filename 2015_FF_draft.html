      <h4>Why is the draft order being done this way?</h4>

      <p>This is a unique way to choose the draft order/first round (2 birds with one stone) that is both Fun and Fair to everyone. It combines a little bit of strategy, with a little bit of skill, with a little bit of luck. It may have zero impact overall, but I think it has a good chance to make things interesting.</p>

      <h4>How will the first round players be chosen?</h4>

      <p>The top 10 players in Yahoo's 100s rankings and 2 wild card players.</p>

      <p>Now I know what you are thinking <span style="font-style: italic;">"But Frank you don't understand I am a Fantasy Football God! I have my own super secret special ranking system to give me an edge and this is going to cramp my style!"</span>. Get over yourself. The fact is, we all use pretty much the same print out every year and the first round is always boring as hell because of it. Don't believe me? Look it up. With the exception of Darren McFadden in 2012, Aaron Rodgers in 2013, 2014, and Peyton Manning 2014, every single first round pick was in Yahoo's top 10 (or 12 because we had 12 teams last year). We could do the top 12 and still be good, but I think the wild card players are going to be a fun twist, but we will get to them in a minute.</p>

      <h4>Which players get which cups?</h4>

      <p>Going by last year's final standings, team owners will have the option to assign one player to a specific cup (example front cup in the diamond ) OR choose a wild card player.</p>

      <p>The order is: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Minder</li>
        <li>Vinny</li>
        <li>Messisca</li>
        <li>Chris</li>
        <li>Warren</li>
        <li>Dana</li>
        <li>Dan</li>
        <li>Mike</li>
        <li>Frank</li>
        <li>Eric</li>
        <li>Dom</li>
        <li>Joe</li>
      </ol>
      <p>(Playoff teams in the order they finished, and regular season standings for non playoff teams)</p>

      <h4>Wild Card Players</h4>

      <p>If you decide to choose a wild card player, you get to choose any player you want and they will be added to the top 10 list that make up our first round selections. You do not get to place this player's cup on the board however. The wild cards will be the last two cups placed in the two remaining spots. If no one in the first 10 picks chooses a wild card, then Dom will get to choose any player he wants and place the cup where ever he wants, and Joe will get to choose any player he wants and fill the last spot in the diamond.</p>

      <h4>Wild cards are stupid why are you doing this?</h4>

      <p>I like doing wild cards because its an extra layer of strategy added to the first round. If there is a player that you really want to choose in the first round that's not in the top 10 (Aaron Rodgers) you have the option. On the flip side, if you think its really funny to guarantee Arian Foster or a kicker or something gets drafted in the first round, you can but you also take a chance that player winds up on your team.</p>

      <h4>How will the shooting order be determined?</h4>

      <p>The order of the shooters will be chosen randomly. If you are in our fantasy baseball league, you saw the program I wrote to randomly generate a draft order. I will be doing the same thing here but with a better user interface and more drama to make it exciting. </p>

      <p>This part will be done AFTER the players have been assigned to a cup/wild cards are chosen. I believe that the front cups will be easier to hit (on purpose) than the back cups. For this reason, we have to decide which cups get which players before we know the draft order. Maybe you want to place your top choice in the front position an hope you are one of the first ones to shoot, or maybe you want to place Eddie Lacy in the dead center so that whoever tries to target him has a good chance of accidentally hitting a different cup, or maybe my guess is wrong and you are a back row sniper.</p>

      <h4>What if I get stuck with a player that I don't want?</h4>

      <p>My advice is to keep it to yourself. This league always has been and always will be a trade friendly league. If for whatever reason you don't want your first round pick, history shows that most likely you have a player that someone wants. I think one of the interesting dynamics of doing the draft this way is that it will create a lot more trades where savvy owners can make deals based on how people value certain players (for example me and my distaste for jamall charles) and boring owners can always swap firsts. You are never stuck with any player in this league. You can always trade and/or cut them.</p>

      <h4>How does the second round work?</h4>

      <p>The player who hits the first cup will also have the first pick in the second round. We will then do the typical snake order where last pick in 2nd round will have first pick in 3rd round.</p>

      <p>Typically, the first pick overall has the last pick in second round but the reason for this is because it is fair that if you get the "best" player everyone else should get two players before you pick again. However, there is no guarantee the first cup will be the "best" as predicted by most draft projections (which are typically wrong for what its worth) so this logic doesn't apply until the second round.</p>

      <h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>

      <p>The people who have expressed the most criticism to this way of doing the draft were not part of the Original 8 so I want to repeat the principals this league is founded on.</p>

      <p>The reason why I wanted to start this league, and the sole reason why this league exists is to be different from every other fantasy football league. This league values fun over everything else. Competition is good, but if you are looking for an ultra competitive cut throat league where winning is the only thing that matters than go join a $1000 buy in.</p>

      <p>Majority does not rule in this league. We can vote on league changes and I am more than happy to debate the merits of one choice over the other with anyone, but ultimately I am going to make the final decision based on two factors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Does it make the league more fun</li>
        <li>Is it fair</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A sure fire way to becoming like every other fantasy league is to let majority rule. People by nature don't like change or things being different so to protect against this I will have the right to overrule majority. You can call me a dictator or even worse, Goodell, but I trust my ability to be fair to everyone (and i think my track record as Commish shows this). It allows me to go against the grain when I believe there is a more fun way to do something. </p>

      <p> If you want to suggest a change in the league, PPR for instance, then you have to make an argument as to why PPR will make the league more fun and/or fair. "Because all my other leagues are PPR" is not a good argument.</p>

      <p>I will <span style="font-weight: bold;">ALWAYS</span> be adding/removing new twists every year, whether it's how we do the draft order, adding a 2nd starting QB, or having individual defensive players with safeties worth 14 points. The twists will always be fair, meaning they impact everyone in the league the same way, but also force you to think differently about strategy. If you don't like change this may not be the league for you.</p>

      <p>I love each and everyone one of you to death and hope you don't decide to leave, but if you do because of the way we are doing the draft or because majority doesn't always rule then I understand. There will be no hard feelings. The truth is we have a waiting list of people who would like to join the league but can't because I don't think expanding over 12 people is a good idea. And to be honest, I would rather be in a league with 8 people who share the same values and beliefs of what this league should be than be in a 12 team league that is nothing more than league number X for you this season.</p>

      <p>For what its worth, quitting an entire league over 1 player is extremely stupid. And if you feel this strongly about it, then you probably take fantasy football a little bit too seriously for this league. There is nothing wrong with that, but we just aren't the right fit.</p>

      <p>Hope to see you all at the draft.</p>

      <p>--The Commish</p>
